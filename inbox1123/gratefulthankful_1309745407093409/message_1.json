We wanted to find the next growth pockets and spent the last one year venturing out, researching and buying some lands (registering them). We aspire to aquire 1000 acres and would want to expand it to 5000 acres if others want to join in. Ping us, if you want to pick AT LEAST 100 acres at 2.5-4 lakh per acre. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see how we can accommodate.",
