All the latest videos that have been published about 'x' acre of land available should have an address written on them through the full reel because most people watch only 3\u00e2\u0080\u00934 seconds of the reel, and if they get the address written on the first 5 seconds, it will be good for them to have a proper knowledge of the location.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n3. The logo and phone are also mentioned on the screen through the full video. This will help in branding and make it easy for the audience to get in touch because only a few people click on the username and then see all the details in the account's bio.",
